- 👋 Hi, I’m Aljosha (*ok you can call me Alex if Aljoscha is too hard to pronounce*) and my web name is @bubblegumsharkie 🦈 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding. A lot. I have a masters degree in Computer Science from Bauman Moscow State University.
- 🌱 I’m learning Java and all that comes with it — Hibernate, Postgres, Spring, RabbitMQ etc...
-  👨‍💻 Currently I work as a UI/UX Designer/Analyst but I managed to get a part-time internship as a mobile dev. Hope to achieve a fulltime position soon!
